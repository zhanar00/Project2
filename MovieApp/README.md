Movies App
Movies App is a web application for searching movies using the The Movie Database (TMDb) API. It allows you to search for movies, sort them by popularity, rating, and release date, as well as save your favorite movies to a "watchlist" for later viewing.

Features:
Movie Search: Search for movies by title.
Sort Movies: Sort movies by popularity, release date, or rating.
Add to Watchlist: Add movies to your personal watchlist.
Watchlist Page: View all the movies you’ve added to your watchlist on a dedicated page.
Requirements:
HTML: The structure of the page.
CSS: Styles for the app.
JavaScript: Logic to interact with the TMDb API and manage app state.
API: TMDb API to fetch movie information.
Installation:
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Копировать код
git clone https://github.com/your-username/movies-app.git
Navigate to the project folder:

bash
Копировать код
cd movies-app
Open the index.html file in your browser to start using the app.

How it Works:
The app uses the TMDb API to fetch movie data.
All added movies are saved in your browser's localStorage, so your watchlist is preserved even after the page is reloaded.
The Watchlist page displays all movies that have been added to the list.
